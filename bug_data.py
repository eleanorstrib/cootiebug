rules = [" The object of this game is to draw a completed cootie bug before the other players.\r\r Type 'play' to start; the program will roll the dice \U0001F3B2  (generate a random number) for you and itself. \rWhoever has the higher number after the dice are rolled will go first. \r\r Each player must get a one for the body then a two for the head, in that order. If not, the user forfeits their turn.", "\rOnce the head and body are added, other body parts can be added in any order.\r After the head and the body, the player can get the rest of the parts in any order, but if the user rolls the number for a part they already have, they forfeit their turn.\r\r When players roll the number of a part they need, they get a free roll to attempt to get part they don't already have."]
